### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a software developer, I stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the web industry. I focus on cloud computing, new programming languages, and procedures that improve reliability and automation.

I am strongly interested in making the code more isolated, independent, maintainable, and testable. I'm also interested in software design principles (e.g., Hexagonal Architecture, SOLID, TDD, DDD, CQRS, and ES).

I am passionate about fostering efficient and resilient software development environments by embracing the DevOps culture. I work with systems teams to ensure smooth operations and am always looking for new ways to be more autonomous. 

Clear communication and knowledge sharing are essential for team success. Mentoring junior developers and learning from others is enjoyable.

I am a dedicated software developer who keeps up with the latest technologies and values effective collaboration. I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to any team.
